","content":"<p>\\r\\nDeciding when to let go of the past and try new adventures is always stressful, and leading an Open-Source Software project like MODX affords me ample opportunity to experience this nexus of freewill. Unfortunately, it does not always provide the same abundance of time and resources needed to focus on making the hard choices.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThat said, I\\u2019ve done my best to use the delays in innovation the project has experienced over the past couple of years as a time of introspection and experimentation. I\\u2019ve never been one to make rash decisions, and I like to carefully consider as many options as practical when choosing a path to follow. I hope that this will serve the future of the MODX project well by helping us avoid the pitfalls of being over-zealous or adopting radical changes too quickly. That said, it is now critical that the MODX community refocus energy on keeping MODX relevant in the long-term by taking advantage of and highlighting our undeniable strengths, while minimizing and escaping some clear weaknesses and unwelcome complexity.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<a href=\\"https:\\/\\/medium.com\\/@drumshaman\\/keeping-modx-relevant-part-one-42dc6632f86b\\">Read the entire article<\\/a>\\r\\n<\\/p>","richtext":1,"template":3,"menuindex":4,"searchable":1,"cacheable":1,"createdby":1,"createdon":1440207459,"editedby":1,"editedon":1440619985,"deleted":0,"deletedon":0,"deletedby":0,"publishedon":1424054220,"publishedby":1,"menutitle":"","donthit":0,"privateweb":0,"privatemgr":0,"content_dispo":0,"hidemenu":0,"class_key":"modDocument","context_key":"web","content_type":1,"uri":"","uri_override":0,"hide_children_in_tree":0,"show_in_tree":0,"properties":null}',
